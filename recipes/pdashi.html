    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Primary Dashi is mainly used for clear soups because of its fragrance, taste, and clarity. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart (1 L) of cold water</li>
            <li>1 ounce (30g) giant kelp (konbu)</li>
            <li>1 ounce (30g) driend bonito flakes (hana-katsuo)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><em>To prepare:</em> Fill a medium-sized soup pot with 1 quart (1 L) cold water and put in kelp. Heat till the water reaches boiling point. It is <strong>important</strong> to know that Kelp has a strong order if it is boiled, so remove the kombu just before the water boils.
        To check if the stock is ready touch the kelp. If it is soft then pull it out. If its tough place it back into the pot for 1 to 2 minutes. To not let the water boil add roughly 1/4 cup of cold water. After removing the konbu bring the stock to a full boil.
        Then add 1/4 cup cold water to bring the temperature down and immediately add the bonito flakes. Then bring to a full boil and remove from the heat immediately. Allow the flakes to settle at the bottom, then remove the foam, and filter through a cheese cloth. </p>
